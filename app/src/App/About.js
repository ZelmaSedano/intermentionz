          InterMention is an application that's built on the Psychological
          concept of Cognitive Restructuring. Cognitive Restructuring is a
          technique that helps one <em>change</em> their internal thought
          patterns using Cues & Reminders. Thought patterns are the inner
          monologue that you and I both have, and depending on our past
          experiences in life, or even just our genetic makeup, these thought
          patterns can be warped and overly negative.

          Your outlook can effect how you feel, and that in turn can effect how
          you behave. This can be visualized using the Cognitive Behavioral
          Cycle:

        <div className="about-img">
          <img
            className="about-img-2"
            src={CBT}
            alt="cognitive-behavioral-cycle"
          ></img>
        </div>
        <p className="about-p">
          What if we could intervene and counteract negative thoughts with more
          positive, balanced thoughts? That's where InterMention comes into
          play. Make a table of custom reminders / mentions and view those
          mentions throughout the day to <em>reinforce</em> and
          <em>condition</em> ourselves until we believe them.

          Science says it works, so try it today! And don't forget, if you want
          to receive your favorite mention as a reminder via SMS, just click the
          radio button next to that mention!
